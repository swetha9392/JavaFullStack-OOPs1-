ðŸ§  Java Core Concepts â€” Explained with Examples

Welcome to my Java Concepts Repository!
This repository contains clear explanations and example codes of important Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, created for quick revision and learning.

ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation â€” Binding data and methods together, and using getters/setters.

ðŸ”¹ Anonymous Object â€” Creating and using objects without names.

ðŸ”¹ Packages â€” Organizing classes and avoiding name conflicts.

ðŸ”¹ Access Modifiers â€” Controlling visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

ðŸ”¹ Polymorphism â€” Compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).

ðŸ”¹ Object Class â€” The root of all Java classes and its common methods.

ðŸ”¹ Upcasting & Downcasting â€” Type conversions between parent and child classes.

ðŸ”¹ Wrapper Classes â€” Converting primitives into objects (and vice versa).

ðŸ”¹ Inner Classes â€” Types of inner classes with real examples.

ðŸ’» Purpose

I created this repository to:

Strengthen my core Java knowledge

Prepare for technical interviews

Keep all my Java revision notes and examples in one place
